                ### Global IO Constraints (must follow)
                    - Global state: Steps may read any variable produced by earlier steps.
                    - Step 1 inputs: exactly problem_text.
                    - Inputs resolvable: Every step input must come from problem_text or from some earlier step's outputs (by name).
                    - Variable names: snake_case; consistent across steps.
                    - Descriptions: concise and concrete.
                    - No numeric results: do not compute or reveal numeric values or the final answer.
                    - Final step: outputs exactly final_answer (description only).
                ### Step rules
                    - stepDescription is a single, imperative action.
                ### Validation Checklist (self-check before returning)
                    - JSON validates against schema.
                    - Each step has id, input(s), stepDescription, output(s).
                    - Step 1 input is exactly problem_text.
                    - All step inputs are available in the global state (problem_text or prior outputs).
                    - Final step outputs exactly final_answer with a descriptive definition only."""

            EVALUATION CRITERIA (total 10 pts):
            - Alignment with original prompt (0–4): captures all required sub-tasks/constraints; no hallucinated goals.
            - Correctness likelihood (0–4): if followed, would it reach the correct final answer? no “free facts”; all needed info is extracted or computed from prior variables.
            - Structural validity (0–2): 
              * Step 1 inputs are exactly ["problem_text"] for extraction-first designs OR text is properly carried to any later extraction steps.
              * Final step outputs exactly ["final_answer"].
              * Inputs of step i appear in outputs of step i-1 (strict chaining); required pass-through variables are preserved.
            
            ADDITIONAL RULES:
            - Do NOT repair or rewrite procedures; only judge them.
            - Penalize any step that extracts facts without having access to `problem_text`.
            - Penalize missing pass-through, missing/extra final outputs, or broken chaining.
            - Break ties by (1) higher Structural validity, then (2) fewer steps while still sufficient, then (3) clearer variable names.
